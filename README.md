# Amazon Clone

This project is a basic clone of Amazon's homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this clone is to recreate Amazon's layout and design elements, focusing on responsive design and UI styling. This project serves as a practice to understand front-end web development concepts and CSS styling techniques.
